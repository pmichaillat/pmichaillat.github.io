This webpage hosts the draft chapters from a book on which I'm working. The book is under contract with Princeton University Press. 

So far only a few chapters are available, but additional chapters will be added over time. I'm sharing these draft chapters to invite feedback from readers. Your comments are invaluable in helping me make the book as correct, clear, and complete as possible. Please don't hesitate [to email me](mailto:pascal.michaillat@gmail.com) with comments and corrections. As the book is a work in progress, the content and structure may change, so thank you for engaging with this preliminary version.
