## Introduction

This course covers topics related to unemployment. Unemployment represents a waste of productive resources and therefore is something that should be limited. In addition to being wasteful, unemployment imposes other, large costs on society. People who are unemployed suffer from lower mental and physical health than employed workers. Even employed people in areas with high unemployment report lower well-being. Accordingly, good economic policy should stabilize unemployment at a desirable level and avoid periods of elevated unemployment.

This course develops a model of unemployment. The model explains why unemployment exists, and why unemployment fluctuates over the business cycle. The course also strives to justify all the assumptions introduced in the model using empirical evidence from the US labor market. 

The model is helpful to design policies to tackle unemployment effectively. First, the model is useful to determine what is the socially efficient level of unemployment. This socially efficient level of unemployment is a key ingredient to good labor market policies. Second, the model explains how various labor market policies should respond to fluctuations in unemployment.

###### Main readings

+ [Darity and Goldsmith (1996)](https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.10.1.121) –  This survey reviews the psychosocial consequences of unemployment. It finds that exposure to unemployment severely damages psychological health. One reason is that joblessness creates a sense of helplessness: that one's life is no longer under their control. Furthermore, numerous benefits of work are lost during unemployment, including a structured daily routine, regular interactions and shared experiences with others, a sense of purpose and a source of personal status and identity. 
+ [Frey and Stutzer (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1257/002205102320161320) – This survey provides evidence that personal unemployment and aggregate unemployment significantly reduce happiness. The evidence refers to the pure effect of unemployment, which controls for the income loss from unemployment.

+ [Di Tella, MacCulloch, and Oswald (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1162/003465303772815745) – This paper finds in well-being surveys conducted in Europe and the United States that unemployment make people unhappy. Being unemployed makes you unhappy, and having unemployment in your country makes you unhappy. In fact, after controlling for income and other personal characteristics, becoming unemployed appears as painful as divorcing.
+ [Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2555127) – This paper uses panel data from Germany to show that unemployment causes unhappiness (and not the other way around). It finds that unemployment significantly reduces life satisfaction, and that the non-pecuniary cost of unemployment is much larger than the pecuniary cost.
+ [Borgschulte and Martorell (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1257/app.20160257) – This paper uses administrative data from the US military to compute revealed-preference estimates of the cost of unemployment. It finds that unemployment is indeed very costly.
+ [Hussam, Kelley, Lane, and Zahra (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20211616) – This paper reports the results from a field experiment in Bangladesh designed to measure the psychosocial cost of unemployment. The experiment shows that paid employment raises psychosocial well-being substantially more than the same amount of cash alone. In fact, two-thirds of employed workers would be willing to forgo cash payments and continue working for free. The experiment illustrates just how large the psychosocial cost of unemployment is.

## Labor market facts and matching function

This section reviews basic facts about the labor market and unemployment in the United States. It then introduces the matching function—the main tool that we will use to model the labor market and unemployment. The matching function summarizes the complex process through which workers searching for jobs and firms searching for employees meet each other.

## Matching model of the labor market

This section introduces the matching model of the labor market. This is the model that we will use to study unemployment and labor market policies in this course. Early work on this model was conducted by Peter Diamond, Dale Mortensen, and Christopher Pissarides in the 1970s and 1980s, so the canonical version of the model is often called the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, or DMP model. For their work, Diamond, Mortensen, and Pissarides received the Economics Nobel Prize in 2010. In the matching model, unlike in the neoclassical model, all trades are mediated by a matching function. Nevertheless, we can construct labor supply and labor demand curves, and use them to solve the model.

It finds that firms avoid pay cuts because cuts damage morale and therefore reduce productivity, increase turnover, and complicate recruiting.
+ [Haefke, Sonntag, and Van Rens (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2013.09.003) – This paper estimates that the real wages of new hires are somewhat rigid. The elasticity  of real wages with respect to productivity is between 0.7 and 0.8, so less than 1.

It explains how internal labor markets replaced spot labor markets, and how such replacement provided workers with an employment system that was more bureaucratic, more
rule-bound, and more secure. In particular, wages paid to workers were much more rigid in internal labor markets.

It argues that Ford's decision to increase wages dramatically is the consequence of labor problems of the kind featured in efficiency-wage theories. Moreover, it finds that the five-dollar day resulted in substantial queues for Ford jobs, significant increases in productivity, and maybe surprisingly, significant increases in profits.
+ [Mas (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.121.3.783) – This paper finds evidence in favor of efficiency-wage theories: when police officers receive a wage below what they consider a fair wage, they are disappointed, and their performance on the job drops. This finding confirms that fairness might be an important source of wage rigidity.

## Unemployment fluctuations

This section discusses unemployment fluctuations in the matching model. We first show that the model with rigid wages generates realistic fluctuations in unemployment. We then show that the model with bargained wages is unable to generate such fluctuations. The reason is that bargained wages are too flexible.

###### Main readings

+ [Shimer (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1257/0002828053828572) – This paper shows that the canonical matching model of the labor market (the DMP model) cannot generate realistic fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies. This anomaly of the DMP model is known as the Shimer puzzle. The reason behind the Shimer puzzle is that the wage bargaining protocol assumed in the DMP model—Nash bargaining—produces wages that are too flexible. 
+ [Hall (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1257/0002828053828482) – This paper shows that a matching model with fixed real wages generates large fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies—larger in fact that the fluctuations observed in the United States. Hence fixed real wages solve the Shimer puzzle.

###### Additional readings

+ [Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.98.4.1692) – This paper shows that if workers are almost indifferent between working and not working, then the DMP model can generate realistic fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies. A downside of this assumption, however, is that it is completely inconsistent with the large psychosocial cost of unemployment documented at the beginning of the course. Another downside is that it implies that the socially efficient rate of unemployment is above 20%.
+ [Hall and Milgrom (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.98.4.1653) – This paper proposes a form of wage bargaining that produces somewhat-rigid wages. With such wage rigidity, the matching model generates realistic fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies.
+ [Blanchard and Gali (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1257/mac.2.2.1) – This paper blends the matching model of the labor market with a New Keynesian model of the product market. It then shows that under wage bargaining, unemployment and vacancies do not fluctuate at all in the model. This is a strong form of the Shimer puzzle. By contrast, when the real wage is a subproportional function of labor productivity, the model generates realistic fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies.
+ [Eliaz and Spiegler (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1086/674596) – This paper insert reference-dependent preferences into a matching model. Because of these preferences, wage cuts relative to a reference point make workers feel that they have been treated
unfairly, which dampens their intrinsic motivation and reduces their output. As a result, firms avoid cutting wages. Because wages are rigid downward, unemployment and vacancies respond more to shocks than under Nash bargaining.

## Frictional and rationing unemployment

This section turns to the sources of unemployment over the business cycle. In the DMP model, unemployment becomes vanishingly small when unemployed workers search sufficiently hard for jobs. Unemployment also becomes vanishingly small when recruiting costs are sufficiently low. In other words, the DMP model does not feature job rationing. This lack of job rationing is difficult to reconcile with the long queues of unemployed workers at job bureaus and factory gates observed during the Great Depression. 

The section then develops a matching model with job rationing. In the model, in a recession, jobs are lacking, so some unemployment remains even if workers are desperate to find a job. The model features both frictional unemployment—caused by difficulties in matching workers and firms—and rationing unemployment—caused by a lack of job. The model describes well good and bad times. In bad times, labor demand is low so rationing unemployment is high. Hence total unemployment is high. But, maybe surprisingly, frictional unemployment is low. In that case, workers queue for jobs and it is easy for firms to fill vacancies. Conversely, in good times, labor demand is high so rationing unemployment is low and total unemployment is low. Frictional unemployment is higher than in bad times. In that case, it is easy for workers to find jobs but firms struggle to fill job vacancies.

Technically, the DMP model does not feature job rationing because its labor demand is perfectly elastic with respect to wages and labor market tightness. Once we introduce a labor demand that is downward sloping with respect to wages and tightness, job rationing appears and not all unemployment is frictional. The easiest way to generate a downward-sloping labor demand is by assuming that the production function has diminishing returns to labor.

###### Main readings

+ [Michaillat (2012)](/1.pdf) – This paper first establishes that the DMP model does not have job rationing and then develops a matching model with job rationing. The job-rationing model departs from the DMP model by assuming that the production has diminishing returns to labor instead of constant returns to labor, and that the real wage is given by a rigid wage norm instead of Nash bargaining. In that model unemployment can be decomposed into rationing and frictional components. In recessions, the rationing component is large while the frictional component is small.
+ [Crepon, Duflo, Gurgand, Rathelot, and Zamora (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjt001) – This paper reports the results from a randomized experiment designed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of job-placement assistance on the labor market outcomes of young educated job seekers in France. It finds that job seekers who are given job-placement assistance find jobs more rapidly, while job seekers in the same labor market who are not assisted take longer to find a job. This finding suggests that jobs are somewhat rationed, and that assisted job seekers move ahead of non-assisted job seekers in job queues. The spillovers of job-placement assistance are particularly strong in bad times, when jobs are scarcer.

###### Additional readings

+ [Akerlof, Rose, and Yellen (1988)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2534536) – This paper develops an early matching model of the labor market with job rationing. The model reproduces a number of stylized facts of the US labor market regarding quits and vacancy chains. While the model in not in the DMP tradition, it does feature a Beveridge curve.
+ [Michaillat and Saez (2015)](/3.pdf) – This paper adds aggregate demand to the model in Michaillat (2012). This is done by adding a product market to the labor market with a similar matching structure. Aggregate demand shocks generate fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies along the Beveridge curve. In that model, unemployment can be decomposed into three components: Keynesian unemployment (due to insufficient aggregate demand), classical unemployment (due to high real wages), and frictional unemployment (due to matching frictions).

## Efficient unemployment and unemployment gap

Unlike in neoclassical models, in matching models there is no guarantee of efficiency. The prevailing unemployment rate is generally inefficient: either too high or too low.

This section defines and computes the socially efficient rate of unemployment in the matching model. It then extends the analysis to all models with a Beveridge curve—not only the matching model. It develops measures of the efficient labor market tightness and efficient unemployment rate. It also develops a measure of the unemployment gap to assess how far the unemployment rate is from its socially efficient level. The measure depends on three sufficient statistics: recruiting cost, social value of nonwork, and elasticity of the Beveridge curve.

The section finally shows that in the United States, the unemployment gap is generally positive and is sharply countercyclical. This means that the US labor market is generally inefficiently slack and especially inefficiently slack in slumps. For instance, the unemployment gap reached 6 percentage points during the Volcker Recession and the Great Recession.

###### Main readings

+ [Michaillat and Saez (2021)](/9.pdf) – This paper derives sufficient-statistic formulas for efficient labor market tightness and efficient unemployment rate. It applies the formulas to the United States and finds that the US labor market is generally inefficiently slack, and especially inefficiently slack in slumps.
+ [Michaillat and Saez (2024)](/13.pdf) – This paper shows that under simple but realistic assumptions, the sufficient-statistic formula for the efficient unemployment rate from Michaillat and Saez (2021) reduces to $u^\ast = \sqrt{uv}$. This unemployment rate marks not only social efficiency but also full employment. In the United States, 1930–2024, the full-employment rate of unemployment (FERU) $u^\ast$ averages 4.1%.

## Labor-demand policies

Over the business cycle, fluctuations in labor demand generate fluctuations in unemployment that are inefficient. Labor market policies that can influence labor demand should therefore counterbalance these fluctuations and bring the unemployment rate closer to its efficient level. This section discusses how minimum wage, payroll tax, and public employment—all policies that directly influence labor demand—should respond to unemployment fluctuations over the business cycle.

+ [Michaillat (2014)](/2.pdf) – This paper establishes that in a matching model with job rationing, the public-employment multiplier is positive but less than one, and the multiplier is larger when the unemployment rate is higher. These predictions are consistent with a growing body of evidence from the United States and abroad.

## Unemployment insurance

Fluctuations in unemployment raise another policy question: how should the generosity of unemployment insurance respond to unemployment fluctuations? This question was hotly debated during the Great Recession. Some argued that unemployment insurance should be reduced because it discouraged job search and would raise unemployment further. Others countered that unemployment insurance could be increased without raising unemployment much—as there were no jobs available for job seekers.

This section weighs the two sides of the argument. It discusses the different channels through which unemployment insurance affects the labor market. It then derives a formula for optimal unemployment insurance. The formula contrasts how generous unemployment insurance should be in good times and in bad times. The formula shows that the generosity of unemployment insurance should be adjusted over the business cycle; the adjustment depends on how unemployment insurance affects labor market tightness. The effect of unemployment insurance on tightness depends on the model: increasing unemployment insurance may raise tightness by alleviating the rat race for jobs or lower tightness by increasing wages through bargaining.

In the United  States, unemployment insurance is more generous in bad times than in good times. The formula, combined with evidence from the US labor market, suggests that such countercyclical generosity is desirable. The reasons are that labor market tightness is inefficiently low in slumps and inefficiently high in booms (as we saw previously), and that increasing unemployment insurance raises labor market tightness.

The experiment consists of an increase in benefit duration from 52 to 209 weeks for eligible unemployed workers in a subset of regions. Ineligible unemployed workers in treated labor markets experienced significantly lower unemployment duration, which implies that labor market tightness rose in treated labor markets.

It finds that the number of job applications fell while the number of job openings remained that same. Therefore, labor market tightness (the ratio of job openings to job applications) increased when unemployment insurance became more generous.
+ [Dieterle, Bartalotti, and Brummet (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1257/pol.20160439) – This paper shows substantial spillovers across US states when one state changes the duration of its unemployment insurance benefits and the other does not. In particular, workers from the low-benefit state flock to the high-benefit state, suggesting increased job-finding rates and thus increased labor market tightness in the high-benefit state.
