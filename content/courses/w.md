## Introduction

This course covers research topics related to economic slack. So what is economic slack? Economic slack describes productive resources in the economy that are unused. There are many different forms of slack: people who cannot find a job and remain unemployed; machines left idle in a factory; employed workers left idle on the job; hotel rooms, restaurants table, airplane seats that remain vacant; durable goods that cannot be sold and depreciate; perishable goods that cannot be sold and go to waste.

Economic slack represents a waste of productive resources, and it therefore is something that should be limited. In addition to being wasteful, unemployment imposes other, large costs on society. People who are unemployed suffer from lower mental and physical health than employed workers. Even employed people in areas with high unemployment report lower well-being. Accordingly, good economic policy should stabilize economic slack at a desirable level and avoid periods of elevated slack.

In the course we introduce a basic slackish model of the economy and several variants of it. The term ``slackish'' is used to describe a class of models where economic slack is not only prevalent but also the central mechanism to equalize supply and demand. In these models the amount of slack---measured by the market tightness---is the key mediating variable, irrespective of whether the market is inefficiently slack or tight. Slackish does not imply that markets are always too slack; rather, it refers to the structural mechanism through which markets operate. In these markets, the market tightness, not the market price, adjusts to equilibrate supply and demand and to determine allocations and welfare.

We use the slackish model to answer a range of questions: 

+ Why does slack exist? 
+ How does slack affect economic life? 
+ Why does slack vary over time? 
+ How are slack fluctuations related to price and wage rigidities?
+ What is the socially optimal amount of slack?
+ How should monetary policy respond to cyclical fluctuations in slack?
+ How should fiscal policy respond to fluctuations in cyclical slack?
+ What happens at the zero lower bound? 

The course is centered around formal modeling, but it also presents evidence supporting the assumptions introduced in the models.

Being unemployed makes you unhappy, and having unemployment in your country makes you unhappy. In fact, after controlling for income and other personal characteristics, becoming unemployed appears as painful as divorcing.

## Overview of business-cycle models

This section first reviews the Kuhnian model of science. It then uses the Kuhnian perspective to understand how, over the past century, business-cycle macroeconomics evolved from the IS-LM model (inspired by Keynes's *General Theory*) to the General Disequilibrium model (with nonclearing markets) to the Real Business-Cycle model (with perfectly competitive markets) and finally to the New Keynesian model (with monopolistically competitive markets).

Modern business-cycle models—both Real Business-Cycle model New Keynesian model—focus on fluctuations in prices and quantities. By contrast, the business-cycle model developed in this course accounts for fluctuations in prices, quantities, and slack. Introducing slack is especially important to study business cycles because slack varies far more than prices over the business cycle. Introducing slack is necessary to study business-cycle stabilization policies because fluctuations in slack have large consequences for welfare.

## Prevalence of slack and matching function

This section documents the presence of economic slack on the labor market (unemployed workers) and on the product market (idle labor and capital). It also documents that such slack always coexists with vacant jobs and unfulfilled consumption. Then, it introduces the matching function, which is the tool that we will use to model the coexistence of unemployed workers and vacant jobs, and of idle labor and unfulfilled consumption. The matching function summarizes the complex process through which workers searching for jobs meet firms searching for employees, and producers searching for customers meet consumers searching for sellers.

The business-cycle model developed in this course differs from canonical business-cycle models because it introduces a matching function in both labor and product markets. In contrast, the Real Business-Cycle model features perfectly competitive labor and product markets. The New Keynesian model features monopolistic competition on the two markets. And older disequilibrium models feature nonclearing Walrasian markets.

## Basic slackish model

This section develops a basic slackish model of the economy. The model is static. It is built around a matching function. Because of the matching function, self-employed workers are not able to sell all their services: there is always some slack. Wealth (in the form of real money balances) enters the utility function. People derive direct utility from wealth because wealth is a marker of social status, and people value high social status. Thanks to this assumption, and although the model is static, the aggregate demand is nondegenerate.

## Slackish model with income and wealth inequality

This section introduces income and wealth inequality in the slackish model. We compute the aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves with inequality, and show how the model with inequality can be solved. In the model the marginal propensity to spend varies with slack, and the deviation from Say's Law appears clearly.

## Discussion of the solution concept

This section provides additional discussions of the solution concept used in the slackish model, and discusses an interesting special case. It also shows how the model solution is the equilibrium (in the sense from physics not economics) of a dynamical model in which households slowly learn the market tightness.

## Price and wage rigidities

The slackish model requires specifying price norms. Theoretically, there are many possibilities. We could assume that prices equilibrate supply and demand while tightness remains fixed. If the tightness is fixed at the right level, the economy is always efficient, in the spirit of a perfectly competitive, Walrasian model. We could also assume that tightness equilibrates supply and demand while prices remain fixed, in the spirit of a fixprice, Keynesian model. In that case, the economy is generically inefficient, either too slack or too tight. Or we could assume something in between, where tightness and prices jointly adjust to equilibrate supply and demand. 

This section reviews evidence from microdata and ethnographic surveys. The evidence suggests that prices and wages are not fully flexible but instead somewhat rigid, and that fairness is a key reason behind price and wage rigidities. The section then shows how realistic pricing norms can be inserted into the slackish model. It also derives comparative statics in response to aggregate demand and aggregate supply shocks under fixed prices and rigid prices. It contrasts these results to those obtained under bargained prices.

The model yields price rigidity and realistic Phillips curves.

## Slackish model with labor and product markets

This section presents a slackish model with two markets: a labor market with unemployment and a product market with idleness. Each market is organized around a matching function. Unemployment and idleness interact with each other. For instance, after an increase in aggregate demand, firms find more customers. This reduces the idle time of firms' employees and thus increases firms' labor demand. This in turn reduces unemployment.

In this two-market model, not all workers are employed, and not all goods and services produced by firms are sold. The model therefore incorporates the three traditional types of unemployment: Keynesian, classical, and frictional. Unemployment has a Keynesian component because it depends on how easy or difficult it is for firms to sell their goods. It has a classical component because it depends on the real wage. And it has a frictional component because it depends on how costly it is for firms to recruit workers.

Moreover, the comovements between output, employment, product-market tightness, and labor-market tightness observed in the United States through the lens of the model indicate that unemployment fluctuations are caused by fluctuations in labor demand, themselves caused by fluctuations in aggregate demand.

## Dynamic slackish model

This section presents a dynamic version of the slackish model. In the dynamic model, unemployment is determined by the intersection of an aggregate demand curve, stemming from households' consumption-saving decisions, and an aggregate supply curve, corresponding to the Beveridge curve.

An advantage of moving to a dynamic environment is that interest rates appear into the model. Indeed, the real interest rate is a key determinant of aggregate demand. By setting a nominal interest rate, the central bank can stabilize the economy. The model is therefore useful to study the effect of monetary policy on unemployment—for instance to assess the possibility of a soft landing in the aftermath of the pandemic inflation spike.

## Social welfare, efficiency, and inefficiency

Unlike in neoclassical models, in slackish models the economy generally operates inefficiently. Except in knife-edge cases, there is too much or too little slack. Since the unemployment rate is generally inefficient, it is critical to know whether the current unemployment rate is above or below the efficient unemployment rate.

This section therefore develops a simple formula for the efficient amount of unemployment. It shows that under simple but realistic assumptions, the efficient unemployment rate is the geometric average of the unemployment and vacancy rates: $u^\ast = \sqrt{uv}$. Hence, the economy is efficient when there are as many vacancies as jobseekers, inefficiently tight when there are more vacancies than jobseekers, and inefficiently slack when there are more jobseekers than vacancies.

Finally, the section applies the formula to the US economy. In general the US economy is inefficient. It is especially inefficiently slack in slumps.  For instance, the unemployment gap reached 6 percentage points during the Volcker Recession, the Great Recession, and the Coronavirus Recession. By contrast, in 2022–2024, the US economy was inefficiently tight: the unemployment gap was as low as -1.5 percentage point in 2022.

## Optimal monetary policy over the business cycle

Since the US unemployment rate is always inefficiently high in slumps, and sometimes inefficiently low in booms, monetary policy has scope to stabilize the unemployment rate better.

This section describes optimal monetary policy over the business cycle. Monetary policy influences the aggregate demand curve, so it can be used to shrink the unemployment gap. The optimal monetary policy is to adjust interest rates to eliminate the unemployment gap entirely. So the central bank should lower rates in bad times, when unemployment is inefficiently high, and raise rates in good times, when unemployment is inefficiently low.

In fact, given such optimality criterion, we can develop a simple formula for optimal monetary policy. The formula relates the optimal interest rate to two sufficient statistics: the unemployment gap and the monetary multiplier (the effect of the federal funds rate on the unemployment rate). In the United States, the monetary multiplier is about 0.5. The formula then indicates that the Fed should raise the federal funds rate by 2 percentage point for any 1 percentage point of unemployment gap.

## Optimal government spending over the business cycle

Monetary policy should eliminate the unemployment gap, but this is not always possible. Once monetary policy reaches the zero lower bound, for instance, it becomes impotent, and it has to be supplemented by fiscal policy.

This section studies how government spending should be adjusted when unemployment is inefficient. It shows that optimal government spending deviates from the Samuelson rule to reduce, but not eliminate, the unemployment gap. The amplitude of the deviation depends on three sufficient statistics: unemployment gap, fiscal multiplier, and elasticity of substitution between public and private goods. Since the unemployment gap is countercyclical, optimal government spending is also countercyclical. That is, the government should spend more in bad times and less in good times.
